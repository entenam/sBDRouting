Routing
This is a Routing layer module that can be added into Castalia. 
This code implements 'Sector Based Distance Routing' Protocol.

Following publications explains the protocol - 

Ahmed, K., & Gregory, M. A. (2012, December). Optimized TDMA based distance routing for Data Centric Storage. 
In 2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Networked Embedded Systems for Every Application (NESEA) (pp. 1-7). IEEE.

Following publication discuss in detail how to add a module into Castalia
